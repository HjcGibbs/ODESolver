Hello!

This is a ode solver that I had to write with two friends for a project. It is
pretty simple, but I think that the maths behind the multi-step and implcit
numerical methods is pretty cool. At the moment it solves the lorenz attractor
but it can be changed by editing the main file and adding a new ode function.
The input is either 'Eulers', 'RK4' or 'IRK4', these refer to Eulers method, 
the explicit Runge Kutta method of order 4 and the implicit Runge Kutta method
of order 4. The part which was mostly worked on by myself is the irk4 solver, 
but I did mess around in all the files to fix bugs and optimise various 
things: the first versions were not nearly as pretty!

The other two members of the group were Ben Madafiglio and Sebastian Blefari.

Feel free to take a look at how it works, it was an interesting project but
once you understand everything there isn't much to it and since MATLAB
has a built in ode solver, I can't see any purpose for this other than 
education.
